=begin
Write a program that lets you enter commands such as feed and walk.
Since we are putting just string we need a dispatch method that checks
which string was entered and then calls the appropiate method

class BabyDragon
  def initialize
    @name = name
  end

  def feed #A function for feeding
  end

  def walk #A function for walking
  end

  def sleep
  end

  def time_passes
  end

  def command #A function to check the comands
  end

  def dispatch #Checks the strings
  end
end
